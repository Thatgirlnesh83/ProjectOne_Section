    <p><br>I love flowers to say the least and the way he creates his designs are amazing. I wish I could post more. I discovered him looking on instagram, working with the Kardashians as their floral designer. I kept wondering who's behind these masterpieces. I fell in love. I love how he goes out the box and his scale is grand. His simplicity with the colors and lines.</p>

    <h4><br>Kahlana is very simple and I love black , white , earth tones , and bold colors. Whether it's a striped button up with some Nike dunks at work or a blazer with heels for sundry brunch with the girls , her style is my go to for inspiration. I love her oversized jeans and blazers with heels.</h4>

    <h4><br> Wiley's ability to blend classical artistic techniques with modern themes and cultural references creates a unique and dynamic visual language. His vibrant portraits celebrate the diversity and individuality of people of color and even more beautiful in person as I show his showcase in 2023 at the DeYoung Museum.</h4>
