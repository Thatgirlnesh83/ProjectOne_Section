    <h1> My name is Anesha</h1>

    <p>I was beautifully born in 1983, rooted in strength and a soulful spirit. At 18, I became a mother, and as I walked across the stage to receive my diploma, I looked over at my son, knowing I was setting the foundation for our future. Without hesitation, I enrolled in college, but the world of biotech and biopharma captured my attention..</p>
    <p>I fell in love with Quality Assurance—a career that became my purpose for the next 20 years. I ensured processes, documents, and operators met the highest standards of compliance, but most importantly, I played a role in delivering vital medicines to patients with rare diseases.</p>
    <p>Determined to finally chase my true passion, I earned my associate degree and took a bold step toward my dream—landing at San Francisco State University’s School of Design.

    <p>I haven't settled on a specific title just yet, but the idea of becoming a Creative Director feels like the perfect blend of leadership and artistry. This is my time to bloom, and I’m embracing the journey with excitement and purpose.</p>
